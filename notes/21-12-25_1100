<h1>Others and the heat</h1>
<div class="meta">Thank god for the waterhole</div>
<div class="content">To my Princess Momo,

This morning is another one cursed with heat.

We received reinforcements from the north (my sister). We went on to cool our heads in the local waterhole (pool).

This helped alleviate the heat, which has also cause a water main to break (sprinkler).

I fixed it with some cable ties and now I lay here writing to you as the wind (ceiling fan) flows over me.

Lunch will come soon, I think of you the whole time and hope that the south is treating you nicely and you are well fed.

Regards, your dearest Mr Chootie</div>
