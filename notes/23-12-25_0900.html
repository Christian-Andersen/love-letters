<h1>War is hell</h1>

<div class="content">To my dearest and lovely Momo,

War is hell, when I have to wake up without you.

They say the distnace makes the heart grow fonder, by baby, my hearts already yours.

The sun will rise and set today, but I'll never truly be awake - not without you.

Regards, the guy you loves you (me, a.k.a. Chootie)</div>
