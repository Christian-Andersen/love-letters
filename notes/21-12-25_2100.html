<div class="content">For my lovely Momo,

Today has been a day of rest, tomorrow I have to move to the front lines (work).

I will dream of your face tonight, as you are the strength who gets me through.

Never forget that you are amazing and soon I will come back to you.

We can dance our hearts out as we celebrate my return. I'm counting down the hours ❤️

Regards, Mr Momo</div>
