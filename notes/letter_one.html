<h1>June 12, 1944</h1>
<div class="meta">To my dearest — from the front</div>
<div class="content">My love,

The days have been long and the nights longer still. I tuck this paper into my coat and imagine your hand holding it. The fields smell of rain, and every distant rumble makes my heart lean toward you.

I found a locket today with a photograph inside — a small thing that reminded me of the life I hope to return to. Keep a candle by the window for me, as you always do.

Forever yours,
E.</div>
