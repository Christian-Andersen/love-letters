<h1>Last day of fighting</h1>
<div class="meta">for now</div>
<div class="content">To the lovely Momo,

A cool breeze has swept across the lands today. I feel as though it marks the end of the fighting.

Come around 1pm today, I can stop fighting until the new year.

However that will be different, because I will be fighting by your side.

I look forward to your arrival!

Regards, Mr Momo</div>
