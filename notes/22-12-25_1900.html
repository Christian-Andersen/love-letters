<div class="content">To the Momo,

Another day of heat, luckily the southern cool came through (aircon).

Work was fruitful, got some milestones ticked.

But it only reminds me that when the clock strikes 5, I don't get to see you.

I hope this letter gets to you, as I've put my whole heart in it.

Regards, me, Chootie</div>
