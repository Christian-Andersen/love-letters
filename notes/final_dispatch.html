<div class="content">Beloved,

Tonight the camp is quiet, and I dare hope that peace might be on the horizon. I fold this page with care and send it to you thinking of the day we will share bread and not ration codes.

If you read only one line, let it be this: come to the old oak on Market Hill if you can; I will wait.

Ever,
J.</div>
