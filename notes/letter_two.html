<div class="meta">A brief note — keep it close</div>
<div class="content">My dearest,

I write between patrols. The sky here is a steel grey and sometimes I pretend it is the sea and you are on the other shore.

There is talk of movement; should I be away longer than expected, know that you are carried in every thought. I pinned a dried blossom to this page — it is pressed flat, but it holds the memory of summer.

With all my heart,
T.</div>
