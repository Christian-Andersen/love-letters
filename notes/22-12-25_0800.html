<h1>Shipping out today</h1>
<div class="meta">I miss you</div>
<div class="content">To my wife,

Today we ship out to the frontline (work), I will miss you 10 times as much as I did yesterday.

I hope the weather is treating you well back home.

You graced my dreams last night, as we explored the world together, something this war is withholding from us.

When will it end, and I can see you again...

Regards, yours</div>
