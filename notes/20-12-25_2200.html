<h1>Distance is Harsh</h1>
<div class="meta">A brief note — keep it close</div>
<div class="content">My dearest Momo,

As I look up at the stars, their distance from me reminds me of mine from yours.

As the war (heat) rages on, I hope that you are doing better than I, and now I think of you every chance I get.

I hope that this letter reaches you, as the path is perilous (I'm not great at making websites), but none the less I send it in the hope it makes it warms your heart.

With all my heart,
Chootie.</div>
