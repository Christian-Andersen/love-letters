<h1>Another day, another dollar</h1></h1>
<div class="meta">but no her</div>
<div class="content">To my Momo,

From morning till night I slave away, but with no Momo to return home to, why slave?

The rain is heavy, the thunder loud, and so I hope that the weather is fair where you are.

As I look out over the jungle landscape, I am reminded nothing it as beautiful as you are.

Miss you

Regards, the one and only Chootie</div>
